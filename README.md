 Next up is page 2
 Intaial i had this idea to build this page but i was unable to build it due to a lack of skill. My trips in in the end didnt show up on the page even though everything seems fine on the code, it is quite disappointing but if i has started earlier and asked for help this may have not been the case. Ill show though what i wanted it to look like. Cant really show what it looks like now cause there's nothing on the page.
